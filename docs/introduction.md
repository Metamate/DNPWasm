## Introduction

Take the interactive tutorials of the Rider IDE
- Editor Essentials (includes properties, they should learn about this first?)
- Run/Debug Configuration
- Debugging Basics I
- Debugging Basics II
- (Rider Tips. Typing Assists)

A lot of the basic stuff should be self-study (do't repeat SDJ1 and SDJ2 in C#)

Something usable here maybe: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/types/
.. soo much stuff, prolly have to filter a lot and find good overviews/sources.. start here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/
